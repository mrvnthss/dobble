"""
The 'dobble' package provides functionalities for creating custom Dobble playing cards and decks.

It includes modules for defining project-level constants, handling circle packing data,
computing incidence matrices for finite projective planes, and creating Dobble playing cards and decks.

Modules:
    - constants: Defines project-level constants.
    - dobble: Contains functions to create individual Dobble playing cards and full decks of Dobble playing cards.
    - packing: Provides functions for handling circle packing data.
    - utils: Provides utility functions for finite projective planes.
